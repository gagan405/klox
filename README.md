Implements the interpreter as done in [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book.

**Choice of language**

Kotlin is used here, instead of Java, just to get some more hands on practice and 
learning with the beautiful language.

**Build and run**
Uses `Java 17`. Make sure to have it [setup](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70296798/564503) through `jenv` if you are using
multiple versions.

Use gradle to build the package:
~~~
./gradlew clean build
~~~
